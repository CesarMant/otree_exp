# General overview of the experiment
The full experiment consists of two blocks.
Block 1: Trust game. 5 rounds. 
Matching depends on information revealed at the beginning of the session. Rematching after each round.
Block 2: Public goods game with punishment. 5 rounds. 
Matching depends on information revealed at the beginning of the session.
Payment at the end of the activity is the sum of one randomly chosen round from Block 1 and the cumulative payoff in Block 2.

The experiment will be conducted in rural China. The experiment will be conducted in Chinese.

### List of errors

# 4
App: trustfield_ch / pgfield_ch / pgfield_only_ch
The decisions in the trust game and the public goods game are elicited using a dropdown menu.
When the LANGUAGUE_CODE is set to 'zh-cn' to conduct the experiment in Chinese, the numbers do not appear in the dropdown menu.
In all the menu options only appears the word "points".

# 5
App: trustfield_ch / pgfield_ch / pgfield_only_ch
In the welcome page the ethnicity and religious affiliation of subjects is requested.
To do so I use a predefined list of choices. 
In the current program, the value stored uses unicode characters. 
The problem is that the data cannot be exported at the end of the session.
Alternatively, I tried to define a choice list as tuples ('stored value', 'human readable label')
The problem with this approach is that I cannot use the command "self.get_year_in_school_display()" 
to access the human readable label.
The reason is that I store this information in the dictionary self.participant.vars['variablename']
And then to use it again I use "self.get_others_in_group()[0].participant.vars['variablename']"
So for this method is not possible to use get_FOO_display()

# 6
App: match_trustgame
So far the errors come from the game version with the minimum number of players.
I created another app to deal with the programming of the matching protocol for the trust game.
I need five different matching protocols for the trust game. Each one will be applied in a round:
1. Random matching
2. Matching with someone of the same ethnicity
3. Matching with someone of the same religion
4. Matching with someone of the opposite ethnicity (if there are available subjects)
5. Matching with someone of the opposite religion (if there are available subjects)
The main problem is that in the trust game I need that roles remain fixed.
A sender (id in group 1) in the first round will be always a sender.
A receiver (id in group 2) in the first round will be always a receiver.

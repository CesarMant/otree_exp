        Suppose that participant A sent 30 points to participant B.<br>
        Having received the tripled amount, participant B sent 50 points to participant A.<br>
        In the end, how many points would participant A and B have?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Solution: Participant A would have 70 points and Participant B would have 40 points.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Participant A first sent 30 points to B. It was tripled thus B received 30*3=90 points.<br>
        Then participant B sent 50 points to A. Participant A received exactly 50 points.<br>
        Hence at last participant A would have 50-30+50=70 points, and participant B would have 90-50=40 points.<br>

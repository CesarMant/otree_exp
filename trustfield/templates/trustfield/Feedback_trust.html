        Suppose that you sent 30 points to person B.<br>
        Having received the tripled amount (90 points), person B sent 50 points back to you.<br>
        In the end, how many points would you and person B have?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Solution: You would have 70 points and person B would have 40 points.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> You sent 30 points to person B. It was tripled thus person B received 30*3=90 points.<br>
        Then person B sent 50 points back to you. You received exactly 50 points.<br>
        Hence at last you would have 50-30+50=70 points, and person B would have 90-50=40 points.<br>

        <strong>Solution: Person A would have 70 points and you would have 40 points.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Person A first sent you 30 points. It was tripled thus you received 30*3=90 points.<br>
        Then you sent 50 points back to person A. Person A received exactly 50 points.<br>
        Hence at last person A would have 50-30+50=70 points, and you would have 90-50=40 points.<br>

        Suppose in a group during the first stage:<br>
        A participant contributed 10 points,<br>
        another participant contributed 8 points,<br>
        another participant contributed 5 points and <br>
        another participant contributed 1 point.<br>
        <br>
        Aftwerwards, in the second stage:
        The participant who contributed 5 points spent one disapproval point.<br>
        One disapproval point is assigned to the participant who contributed 5 points.<br>
        <br>
    </p>
        What would be the payoff of the participant who contributed 5 points before and after the second stage?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Solution: 14 points <b>before</b> the second stage and 10 points <b>after</b> the second stage</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
        Total contribution from all participants was 10+8+5+1=24. Total earnings from the project were 24 x 2 = 48.<br>
        Each participant got an equal share of the earnings, that is, 48/4=12. <br>
        Hence, the payoff for the participant who contributed 5 points <b>before the second stage</b> was 10-5+12=17.<br>
        <br>
        The participant who contributed 5 points spent one of his points assigning a disapproval point to another participant.<br>
        One point is deducted from his payoff.<br>
        One disapproval point was assigned to the participant who contributed 5 points.<br>
        Three additional points are deducted from his payoff.<br>
        Hence, the payoff for the participant who contributed 5 points <b>after the second stage</b> was 17-1-3=13.<br>
